-- | Represents a computation that can be suspended at certain points.
-- The intermediate monadic effects can be extracted, which is particularly
-- useful for implementation of Sequential Monte Carlo related methods.
-- All the probabilistic effects are lifted from the transformed monad, but
-- also `suspend` is inserted after each `factor`.
