# Welcome to Monad-Bayes

Monad-Bayes is a library for **probabilistic programming** written in **Haskell**.

**Define distributions** [as programs](/notebooks/Introduction.html)

**Perform inference** [with a variety of standard methods](tutorials.md) [defined compositionally](http://approximateinference.org/accepted/ScibiorGhahramani2016.pdf)

**Integrate with Haskell code** [like this](examples.md) because Monad-Bayes is just a library, not a separate language

## Example

```haskell
model :: Distribution Double
model = do
     x <- bernoulli 0.5
     normal (if x then (-3) else 3) 1

image :: Distribution Plot
image = fmap (plot . histogram 200) (replicateM 100000 model)

sampler image
```

The program `model` is a mixture of Gaussians. Its type `Distribution Double` represents a distribution over reals. 
`image` is a program too: as its type shows, it is a distribution over plots. In particular, plots that arise from forming a 200 bin histogram out of 100000 independent identically distributed (iid) draws from `model`. 
To sample from `image`, we simply write `sampler image`, with the result shown below:


<img src="images/plot.png" 
     width="450" 
     height="300" />
