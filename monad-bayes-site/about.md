Monad-Bayes is a library for **probabilistic programming** written in **Haskell**.

**Define distributions** [as programs]()

**Perform inference** [with a variety of methods]() 


<!-- ```haskell
mh $ ...
``` -->

**Distributions over anything** including [plots](), [diagrams](), [JSONs]() and [streams]()

(A sample from a distribution over diagrams, built by transforming a distribution over infinite lists, i.e. a random walk)
<!-- ](../randomwalk.png) -->
<!-- - why draw a sample and then make a plot when you can just define a distribution over plots instead (see todo). Sample from distributions over JSONs (see todo) or diagrams
- distributions over infinite (lazily evaluated) lists  are great for non-parametrics (see todo)
- build state space models as streams using `pipes`

inference methods are built modularly:

- write a particle filter that performs an MH step after every resampling step in one line (see todo) -->
